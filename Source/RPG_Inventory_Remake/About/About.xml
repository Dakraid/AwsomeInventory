	<description>This is a fork of RPG Style Inventory made for Combat Extended. 
	All credit goes to the author of RPG Style Inventory and Combat Extended, as all codes are ripped from their mods and duct tapped together.
	If you like it, go to the original mod page and leave an upvote.
	
	I will maintain this fork until original mod is made compatible with combat extended.
